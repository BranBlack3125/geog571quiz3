**QTiles layer for Mo'orea**

I created the QTiles displayed in this repository's index.html through a leaflet tileLayer of the island of Mo'orea, just west of Tahiti in French Polynesia. The center of the map is located at -17.5372, -149.8333, with a default scale of 11, and a range in zoom from levels 7 to 15. The tiles were created in QGIS using their QTiles plugin and Tile Server.
